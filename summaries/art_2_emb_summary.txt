A few months ago someone starved to death in our squat, said Muna a 26-year- old Somali woman who has been living inside a run-down university building in Rome since 2006.
Fights have become frequent inside these centres where migrants are abandoned for months, even years, with very little idea of what is happening to them.
"The south of Italy is becoming a concentration camp for migrants," said MS Cordaro as we drove past the CARA Mineo, a processing centre for migrants, which currently holds over 4,000 people.
Stuck between EU regulations, which force them to claim asylum in their first port of call, and the inefficiencies of Italian bureaucracy, many migrants in Italy end up in a limbo of illegality and destitution.
On my first day in Sicily I met Adeel, a 26-year-old Pakistani man who lives in a shanty town just outside a processing centre, with 200 other asylum seekers.
"Year on year the government declares a state of emergency to deal with immigration," said Manuela Scebba who works for the NGO Arci Amari.
In a bid to contain the flow of migrants, EU border-states have traditionally made agreements with neighbouring countries, which do not share their onerous duties towards upholding the human rights of asylum seekers, enshrined in the Geneva Convention.
Why doesn't the EU just come out and say it: We no longer want to abide by the Geneva Convention," Cordaro said.
There are virtually no legal entry routes into Europe; even for asylum seekers fleeing from war-torn countries like Syria.
Earlier this year I travelled across Italy to document the stories of those who arrive to Italy's borders.
For the past 10 years Italy has declared a "state of emergency" in relation to migration nearly every year.
