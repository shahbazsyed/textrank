A few months ago someone starved to death in our squat, said Muna a 26-year- old Somali woman who has been living inside a run-down university building in Rome since 2006.
Fights have become frequent inside these centres where migrants are abandoned for months, even years, with very little idea of what is happening to them.

Stuck between EU regulations, which force them to claim asylum in their first port of call, and the inefficiencies of Italian bureaucracy, many migrants in Italy end up in a limbo of illegality and destitution.
On my first day in Sicily I met Adeel, a 26-year-old Pakistani man who lives in a shanty town just outside a processing centre, with 200 other asylum seekers.
What we really need is an EU policy on migration that goes beyond surveillance and push-backs, which at the moment is virtually non- existent." 
In a bid to contain the flow of migrants, EU border-states have traditionally made agreements with neighbouring countries, which do not share their onerous duties towards upholding the human rights of asylum seekers, enshrined in the Geneva Convention.
The Spanish Guardia Civil (national law enforcement agency) has often been criticised for handing over migrants to Morocco and there are numerous reports of mass expulsions from Greece to Turkey.
There are virtually no legal entry routes into Europe; even for asylum seekers fleeing from war-torn countries like Syria.
For the past 10 years Italy has declared a "state of emergency" in relation to migration nearly every year.
In the meantime, the human rights of migrants have been increasingly sidelined in favour of quick-fix solutions to the "crisis" and tighter border controls.
