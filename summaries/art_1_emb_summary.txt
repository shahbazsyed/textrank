Rather disturbingly, one word seems to connect the activity of the Paris terrorists and that of the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists: iconoclasm.
Nonetheless, it strikes me as fascinating that the cartoonists were profoundly iconoclastic in their constant ridiculing of religion (all religions, it must be noted) – yet it is precisely this same ancient tradition of iconoclasm that inspires Jews and Muslims to resist representational art and, in its most twisted pathological form, to attack the offices of a Paris magazine and slaughter those whose only weapon was the pen.
But the word iconoclast also describes those religious people who refuse and smash representational images, especially of the divine.
And theologically speaking, the reason they are deeply suspicious of divine representation is because they fear that such representations of God might get confused for the real thing.
In the bluntest, rudest, most scatological and offensive of terms, Charlie Hebdo has been insisting that the images people worship are just human creations – bad and dangerous human creations.
Which is why the terrorists, as well as being murderers, are theologically mistaken in thinking Charlie Hebdo is the enemy.
So I can see how some Christians might find disrespectful images of God a la Charlie Hebdo insulting.
After all, they believe it’s possible for images genuinely to capture something of God. But if images can’t capture God – and that’s the Jewish/Islamic position – then bring on the cartoonists.
They thought that Charlie Hebdo’s cartoonists were insulting their human tribe, a tribe they called fellow Muslims.
