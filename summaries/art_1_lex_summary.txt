Rather disturbingly, one word seems to connect the activity of the Paris terrorists and that of the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists: iconoclasm.
Nonetheless, it strikes me as fascinating that the cartoonists were profoundly iconoclastic in their constant ridiculing of religion (all religions, it must be noted) – yet it is precisely this same ancient tradition of iconoclasm that inspires Jews and Muslims to resist representational art and, in its most twisted pathological form, to attack the offices of a Paris magazine and slaughter those whose only weapon was the pen.
But the word iconoclast also describes those religious people who refuse and smash representational images, especially of the divine.
In the bluntest, rudest, most scatological and offensive of terms, Charlie Hebdo has been insisting that the images people worship are just human creations – bad and dangerous human creations.
And what better way of doing this than through satire, like scribbling a little moustache on a grand statue of God.
Jesus, says St Paul, is the image of the invisible God. Without this the whole western tradition of Catholic religious art and eastern tradition of icons is utterly inconceivable.
So I can see how some Christians might find disrespectful images of God a la Charlie Hebdo insulting.
After all, they believe it’s possible for images genuinely to capture something of God. But if images can’t capture God – and that’s the Jewish/Islamic position – then bring on the cartoonists.
But whatever else was happening, it was the atheist cartoonists who were performing the religious function and the apparently believing Muslims who had forgotten their deepest religious insights.
